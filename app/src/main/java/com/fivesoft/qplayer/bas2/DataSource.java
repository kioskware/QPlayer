/**
 * Represents a source of data which can be read and controlled; it can be either a file or any data stream.<br>
 * <p>
 *     To read or control the source you have to establish connection before. To do that, use {@link #connect()} method.<br>
 *     After successful connection, the source is ready to be used.<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     To read data from the source, use {@link #getInputStream()} method.<br>This will return non-null
 *     {@link InputStream} object which can be used to read data from the source.<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Some types of data sources can be controlled. To control the source, use {@link #getOutputStream()} method.<br>
 *     Example of a controlled source can be a TCP socket. In this case, the {@link OutputStream} can be used to send
 *     commands to the server.<br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     If a media source does not support output stream, {@link #getOutputStream()} will return null.<br>
 *     The example of such source is a file data source.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     After finishing using the source, you should close it by calling {@link #close()} method or by using try-with-resources statement.<br>
